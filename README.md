# Boataootz (Go version)

The Go version of my Boataootz (from French "boîte à out's", shortname for toolbox).

## Requirement

This library use generics so the minimum version of Go is 1.18.

## Usage

Don't bother to import it and deal
with `test` that you cannot rename to `t` (idiomatic name of the *testing.T)
or `functional` that you cannot rename to `func` (reserved keyword).

Just copy and paste the code that you want.
